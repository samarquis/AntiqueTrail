# Product Decisions

## Confirmed decisions

### Public, multi-user product

The application is not built for one household. Original research informs the design but personal data and personal assumptions must be removed.

### PWA first

Build a Progressive Web App first. Preserve the ability to package the same app for Android later with Capacitor.

### Public ratings resemble Google-style ratings

Stores have public 1–5 star aggregate ratings and review counts.

### Separate rating concepts

- Public store rating
- Private personal rating
- Private personalized match score

### Preference profile belongs to the user account

Every user's taste model is private and individualized.

### Directory data may be seeded

The initial database may include public records for known stores. Seed data must not include private notes, private rankings, private photos, or household-specific opinions.

### Trip app owns the itinerary

Navigation providers handle only the current leg.

### Professional and commercial standard

The application must be secure, maintainable, moderated, monitored, and polished enough to advertise through printed flyers in participating stores.

### Security is launch-blocking

Security, privacy, moderation, backups, logs, incident response, and authorization testing are required before launch.

### Regional launch

Start with one strong region and verified store data rather than a sparse national launch.
